# ü•î Potato Leaf Disease Classification

## Overview
A deep learning model that classifies potato plant leaves into three categories: Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy. This tool helps farmers identify plant diseases early through image classification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## ü§ñ Model Details
- Input: 256x256 RGB images
- Architecture: CNN with 6 convolutional layers
- Output: 3 classes (Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy)
